# 🧠 Lesson 2: Basic Variables

In Go, variables are used to store values such as numbers, text, or booleans.  
Here are some of the most common variable types you'll use:

---

## 📘 Variable Types
- **bool** → a boolean value, either `true` or `false`
- **string** → a sequence of characters
- **int** → a signed integer
- **float64** → a floating-point number
- **byte** → exactly what it sounds like — 8 bits of data

---

## 🧩 Declaring a Variable (The Sad Way)
```go
var mySkillIssues int
mySkillIssues = 42
mySkillIssues = 42 ```

The first line, var mySkillIssues int, defaults the mySkillIssues variable to its zero value, 0. On the next line, 42 overwrites the zero value.

We will talk about a better way to declare variables in the next lesson   

 **Assignment**
Initialize the variables from the print statement to int, float64, bool and string with their zero values, respectively.
