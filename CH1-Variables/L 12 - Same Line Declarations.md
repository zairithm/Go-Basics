# Same Line Declarations

You can declare multiple variables on the same line:

```
mileage, company := 80276, "Toyota"

```
The above is the same as:

```
mileage := 80276
company := "Toyota"

```

# Assignment

At the top of the main function, declare a float called averageOpenRate and string called displayMessage on the same line.

Initialize them to values:

-> .23

-> is the average open rate of your messages
before they're printed.

```
package main

import "fmt"
func main() {
averageOpenRate, displayMessage := .23 , "is the average open rate of your messages"
	fmt.Println(averageOpenRate, displayMessage)
}

```
