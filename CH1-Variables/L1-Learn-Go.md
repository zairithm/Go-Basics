 first.

**🧩 What to Expect**

For most of this course, you’ll:

Write Go code directly in your editor

Learn core syntax, loops, structs, and concurrency

Build a SaaS-style demo project called Textio, an SMS app

**🧠 Assignment**

*Print Starting Textio server... to the console instead of hello there!.*
> ⚠️ Note: Always start your Go files with `package main`



### 💻 Solution Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Starting Textio server...")
}

## 🧾 Output
<span style="color:limegreen; font-weight:bold;">Starting Textio server...</span>
